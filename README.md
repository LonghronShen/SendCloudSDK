# SendCloudSDK
This is a third party SendCloud SDK for .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.5.1.
Basically, it is designed based on the SendCloud Java SDK, providing these APIs:
* GetServerTimeStampAsync
* SendMailAsync
* SendSmsAsync
* SendSmsCodeAsync
* SendVoiceAsync

Naming has been refreshed to match .NET rules.
